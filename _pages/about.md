I am a chemical engineering Ph.D. interested in the intersection of scientific discovery and high-dimensional datasets. I enjoy mathematics, biology, statistics, coding, and learning from data. 

During my doctoral studies, I computationally and experimentally explored protein homeostasis and regulatory networks by combining proteomic analysis, text mining, and machine learning. I also worked in the biopharmaceutical industry conducting bioinformatic analysis of clinical RNA-seq samples and PubMed text mining data for therapeutic target identification in autoimmune disease treatments. Together, these experiences sparked my passion for analyzing complex datasets to accelerate biological discovery and innovation.
