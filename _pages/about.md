I am a chemical engineering Ph.D. candidate interested in the intersection of scientific discovery and high-dimensional datasets. I enjoy mathematics, biology, statistics, coding, and learning from data. 

More specifically, I computationally and experimentally explore protein homeostasis and regulatory networks in bacteria by combining methods in synthetic biology, chemical biology, and protein engineering. I am particularly interested in the roles protein degradation and synthesis play under growth-limiting conditions.
