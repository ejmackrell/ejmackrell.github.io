      year: 2016-Present
      description:
        - Characterized global regulatory roles of proteolysis in E. coli by combining linear modeling, independent component analysis, ontology enrichment, and regulatory network analysis.
        - Identified 152 novel endogenous protease substrates in growing and growth-arrested E. coli cells by establishing a quantitative proteomic screen.
        - Engineered the degradation of a mutant methionyl-tRNA synthetase to enable time-resolved proteomic analysis of transient physiological states in E. coli.
        - Implicated RNA chaperones and ribosome-binding factors in endoribonuclease-mediated growth arrest through a chemoproteomic analysis in E. coli.
        - Expanded the substrate scope of the P. furiosus tryptophan synthase Î²-subunit by assisting in the construction and screening of a directed evolution-based library.
